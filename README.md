### Features

1. Dynamic Navbar

- Developed a dynamic navigation menu that prominently displays a predetermined list of items.
- Implemented functionality to automatically transfer remaining items to a designated "More" section if they cannot fit within the main menu.
- Ensured that the website's responsiveness is maintained, so that menu items and the "More" section adapt seamlessly to changes in screen size.
- When the screen size decreases, facilitate the reorganization of menu items and their migration to the "More" section. Conversely, as the screen size increases, reintegrated items from the "More" section back into the main menu.

2. 3D Carousel

- Built an engaging circular carousel that showcases featured items.
- Allowed users to navigate through the carousel using arrow controls and user interactions with the displayed cards.
- Upon user interaction with a card, ensured that the carousel smoothly transitions to the main card and highlights the clicked or selected item.
- The items are rotating continuously in a circular manner, creating an infinite loop of content on navigation.
